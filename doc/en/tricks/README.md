# Winplex tricks list

Here are listed some discovered WinPlex tricks and some Supaplex tricks, which
works in WinPlex too.

**Notice**: Bold numbers refers to level with tah number in [tricks.dat][]
levelset.

## `1` Eating falling infotron

When infotron is falling aside to you, it can be eaten same as laying infotron:
either with \<Space>+\<Arrow> or just \<Arrow> at the moment, when infotron
starts to fall in adjacent cell. **(1)**

## `2` Delaying falling zonk

You can delay falling zonk being under it. Wait until zonk will enter a cell
right above you. Now you can go 1 cell down or sidewise, and zonk will delay
until you will free a cell completely. After that the zonk will continue to
fall. If you will wait too long (zonk will be near you in 1/4
cell), then zonk will kill Murphy. If you are too quick, zonk will delay to few
or will not delay. **(2)**

## `3` How to survive under falling green disk

If green disk is falling to you and you cannot run to a side, but you can run
down, you can survive. Wait until green disk will start to enter a cell above
you, then go down. If you are too quick, the disk will make a short pause or will not
stop. If you are too late, you will explode. **(3)**

## `4` Stuck in air with gravity

When gravity is on, you can stuck in air, if you stand right under a port, which
is walkable up. You will not fall while stand is that position.
**(4)**

Same works with Exit, while you hold an \<Arrow> being faced into Exit. If exit
is locked (not enough infotrons), you will stay there until you release
\<Arrow>.

## `5`, `27` Pushing object over an enemy

When you need to push an object (zonk, green disk) over a hole, you can use an
enemy for that. **(5)**

When pushing over moving enemy, it's possible to push an object over a hole 3
cell width. **(27)**

## `6` Frighten enemy

When an enemy comes to you and you cannot go aside to free its way, you can move
back from enemy when it enters a cell near you.

The enemy will turn around and go away, when this done in straight 1 cell width
way.

In case when there are more empty space around, the enemy will make a pause and
then will continue to go. Now you can repeat that second time, so the enemy will
turn to empty space. **(6)**

## `7` How to catch falling green disk

A falling green disk can be pushed 1 cell sideways when is falls near you.
Disk will continue to fall in neighbour column. However when there will no free
space to continue falling, the disk will just stop. So to stop falling disk
safely, it should be pushed onto something in neighbour column.

However, it will not work when disk falls onto another green disk, the last will
explode first. The same is when disk falls onto an enemy. **(7)**

## `8` How to save dummy Murphy

When enemy comes to dummy Murphy and going to explode it, you can prevent it.

When real Murphy is moving between two cells, a dummy enemy is temporary
invulnerable against enemies. **(8)**

This trick can be used in level 37 in LEVELS.D02.

## `9` Catch green disk with explosions

Whe disk falls onto an explosion it will wait until smoke will gone, and then
will continue to fall. However while disk is standing on explosion, you can push
it away. **(9)**

## `10` Pushing over explosions

Movable objects can stand on explosions and can be pushed on top of it. **(10)**

## `11` Walking through smoke

Explosions has two phases. First one is lethal for Murphy. Second is a smoke and
it's not lethal. Murphy can safely walk through smoke while other objects
waiting until it's gone. **(11)**

## `12` Bridge with yellow disks

Two yellow disks can be used to build bridge to more an object through long
hole cell by cell. **(12)**

## `13` Jumping in gravity with enemy

An enemy can be used to jump 1 extra cell while gravity is on. When an enemy
coming to you, you can jump at appropriate moment to let the enemy go in a cell
under you. Then standing on an enemy you can jump 1 extra cell.

In case when an enemy is going up, you can run up in gravity without eating
anything. **(13)**

## `14` Red disk as temporary block

Imaging a situation when an infotron positioned under you across at least 1
extra cell. You cannot eat infotron with \<Space> due to extra cell between.
Also, you cannot just walk down like if you have a zonk on a head. If you have
red disk, you can eat that infotron. You should to release red disk right
in your position, then go down for infotron and go back until red disk explodes.
**(14)**

## `15` Hiding from enemies under red disk

When you release red disk, it will not explode until you run away. Staying so
you can hide from enemies indefinitely. When it becomes safe you can step 1 cell
away and eat red disk back. **(15)**

## `16` Jumping 2 extra cells in gravity with red disk

When gravity is on, you can jump 2 extra cells with red disk explosion. Release
red disk and go up 1 cell on it. Then you need to jump at appropriate moment, so
you will stand on top of explosion. Now you can jump one more extra cell.
**(16)**

## `17` Eat and not fall into a hole in gravity

Imaging you are standing on something eatable while gravity is on. If you will
just eat that, you will fall into a hole. To not fall you need to press
\<Space>+\<Down> right for 1 game tick and then side arrow to run aside. If you
hold \<Space>+\<Down> more than 1 tick or lose 1 tick after releasing it, you
will fall. **(17)**

## `18` Climbing up in gravity to any height with two red disks

When gravity is on, it is possible to climb up to any height with two red disks.
Release 1st disk, go 1 cell up quickly and release 2nd disk. When 2nd disk
released, get 1st disk back with \<Space> and go 1 cell up before you fall.
Repeat until you reach target position.

Everything must be performed with 1 tick accuracy. While releasing 2nd disk you
need to press \<Space>+\<Down> even when 2nd disk is not released yet. It's
pretty hard to perform. 

While writing this (meaning original text in russian somewhere in 200x years)
the only human who can perform this by hands was its author: Kufterin. **(18)**

## `19` Infotron-explosion expansion

Infotron-explosion causing chained explosion almost all becomes chained
infotron-explosion.

Sometimes infotron-explotion overlapping with normal explosion may lose
infotrons. **(19)**

## `20` Unusual explosion 2x4

When explosion initiated in leftmost edge column, the explosion will be 2Ñ…4
shape. Opposite right edge side will not be touched by explosion (when it should).
Check yourself to see how i t works. **(20)**

## `21` Invulnerability against enemies with green disk

Murphy is standing with green disk on head. It is possible to go 1 cell away and
quickly return back under the disk before the last falls. Doing so Murphy
becomes invulnerable against enemies at his bottom side indefinitely while keep
standing. Left and right sides are still vulnerable as usual.

Trick can be repeated with the same disk at the same position many times.
**(21)**

## `22` "Smart green disk" (green disk and electron)

Green disk while falling as close as possible to electron going down will not
explode after 1 cell. In the other cases with either zonk instead of green disk
or snik-snak instead of electron the explosion will be triggered after 1 cell
fall. **(22)**

## `23` Infotron-explosion can prevent normal explosion

When normal explosion covers an electron and something else explosive in
adjacent cell to the electron, then electron-explosion can completely prevent
normal explosion from that object in some cases. Exact behaviour depends of
concrete positions of electron and the another object inside normal-explosion.
There are total 24 different cases. In 12 of them the second object explodes,
while on rest 12 cases it doesn't cause chained explosion. **(23)**

## `24` Climbing by infotrons in gravity

When gravity is on it is possible to climb up by eating infotrons like eating
bases with following difference:

- need to start climbing by eating infotrons;
- can switch eating from infotrons to bases without falling.

Also with help of eating falling infotrons it's possible to move in gravity in
mid air while eating falling infotrons which are falling exactly with 1 cell
offset from each other (see demo). **(24)**

## `25` Magnetising to a wall in gravity

When gravity is on it is possible in some cases to stay magnetised to a wall
just trying to push it. Using jumps on enemies in such cases it is possible to
push up yellow disk, and it will reproduce that situation again, so you can be
magnetised to a wall again (see demo). Repeating that Murphy can climb up in
gravity. **(25)**

## `26` Move zonk down with two red disks

Imaging Murphy stands with a zonk on head. You need to move the zonk down and
catch it. You cannot go aside because the zonk will block the way down. You
cannot just go down because zonk will kill Murphy.

It is possible to do so if you have two red disks. It works the same as
"Climbing up in gravity to any height with two red disks".
Release 1st disk, go 1 cell down, release 2nd disk quickly and eat 1st disk with
\<Space>. Then go 1 cell down to not let the zonk to kill Murphy and return to
take disk back. So you moved the zonk 1 cell down and caught it.

Trick requires 1 tick accuracy. If you are too late to eat 1st disk it will
explode. If you eat 1st disk too quick, releasing the 2nd disk will be cancelled
and the zonk will fall on head. **(26)**

## `28` Infotron falls to green disk

When infotron falls onto green disk the last explodes with 2 tick delay.
It is possible to eat the infotron with \<Space> and run away quickly in that 2
ticks. **(28)**

## `29`, `30` Disappearing/stuck zonk or infotron

Zonk can disappear in some specific cases. See demo for level **29** in
[tricks.dat][] levelset. In that example Murphy go away at the moment, when
the enemy is gone to 1/4 cell from the position pointer by ports right
before infotron begins to slides. Then the enemy enters the cell where the zonk
falls in and so overwrites the zonk by itself. Everithing what is left is visual
glitch of zonk sprite at background.

Zonk and infotron does behave the same in this trick.

This trick requires 1 tick accuracy. If you are too quick, the enemy will not
enter under the zonk. If you are too late, the zonk will explode the enemy.
**(29)**

Also the zonk may stuck **(30)**. The bottom zonk, from which the firts zonk
slides off, must fall to empty cell. Then the top zonk will fall to that cell
and will stuck instead of disappearing. A stuck zonk has unusual behavior:

- another zonk placed on top of stuck zonk cannot be pushed;
- falling green disk being pushed on top of stuck zonk (see "How to catch
  falling green disk" above) will explode.

## `31` Zonk falled on green disk

Green disk can be pushed under falling zonk at specific moment, so the disk
will not explode. See level **31**. Zonk must be 1/4 cell offset when you need
to start pushing the disk. If you are too quick, the disk will explode by the
zonk. If you are too late, the zonk will occupy empty cell aside to disk, so you
would not push the disk.

## `32` Green disk and port

When Murphy pass through a port, he can catch falling green disk by head, so the
disk will explode and Murphy will survive in explosion (see level **32**).
